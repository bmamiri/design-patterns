**This repository is a collection of design patterns I've worked on:**

Singleton `Runtime - Logger - Spring Beans`<br>
Factory Method `Calendar - NumberFormat - ResourceBundle`<br>
Abstract Factory `Farmeworks`<br>
Builder `String Builder`<br>
Prototype `java.lang.Object#clone()`<br>
Adapter `Arrays.asList()`<br>
Bridge `Drivers - JDBC`<br> 
Composite `java.awt.Component - JSF widget`<br>
Decorator `java.io.InputStream - java.util.Collections.checkedList - UI Components`<br>
Facade `java.net.URL - java.faces.context.FacesContext`<br>
Flyweight `java.lang.String - java.lang.Integer#valueOf(int) - Boolean, Byte, Character, Short, Long`<br>
Strategy `java.util.Comparator`<br>
Proxy `java.lang.reflect.proxy - java.rmi.*`<br>
Chain of responsibility<br>
Command<br>
Interpreter<br>
Iterator<br>
Mediator<br>
Memento<br>
Observer<br>
State<br>
Template<br>
Visitor<br>

**Categories:**

**1. Creational**
These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. These patterns can be further categorized 
into Class-creational patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively
 in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

Creational design patterns are Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton, Object Pool and Prototype.

**2. Structural**
These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new 
functionality.

Structural design patterns are Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private Class Data and Proxy.

**3. Behavioral**
Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.

Behavioral patterns are Chain of responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Null Object, 
Observer, State, Strategy, Template method, Visitor
